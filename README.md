# Chat-Application-Java-and-Azure-

This project is a lightweight chat application built in Java and powered by Microsoft Azure for its backend infrastructure. The goal was to design a system that feels simple to use while demonstrating how cloud services can provide scalability, reliability, and modern features to even a small project.

The application enables users to exchange messages in real time, using Azure’s cloud resources for managing connections and data flow. Unlike a local-only chat app, this design focuses on deployment to the cloud, showing how Java applications can be integrated with Azure services like Web Apps, App Service, or SignalR. This makes the project more than just a desktop tool — it’s a proof-of-concept for how chat systems can leverage the cloud.

Some highlights of this project include:

- Cloud-integrated messaging – messages aren’t just local; they’re managed and routed through Azure.

- Java-based frontend/backend logic – demonstrating how Java applications can tie into modern cloud ecosystems.

- Scalable design – built with the idea that more users or extended features (like group chats or multimedia messages) can be added easily.

This project represents more than just a chat client; it’s a small step into understanding cloud computing’s role in everyday applications. By combining Java’s reliability with Azure’s infrastructure, the app becomes both a hands-on learning experience and a showcase of how cloud-ready systems can be built from scratch.
